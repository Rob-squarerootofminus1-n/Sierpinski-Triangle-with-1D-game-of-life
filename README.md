# Sierpinski-Triangle-with-1D-game-of-life
Here's the following of my first Conway's game of life. This version in 1D is possible thanks to the rule 90 of the GoL (go check wikipedia for more information). To get the triangle, you just need to put in first state four cells alive (like this 造造造造 ). The game is in Js, to help me discover this new language!
